My dot files
========================
[![Say Thanks!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-!-1EAEDB.svg)](https://saythanks.io/to/fatso83)

These are my config files for Bash, VIM, Python, tmux and more. Also includes a handful of [utility scripts](./utils/scripts) 
and quite a lot of [aliases/functions]([https://github.com/fatso83/dotfiles/blob/master/common-setup/bash.d/bash_aliases_functions](https://github.com/fatso83/dotfiles/blob/7958268/common-setup/bash.d/aliases_functions)) I find useful and re-use quite often.

This repo is under a [do as you please license](./LICENSE) :)


## Intentionally simple
I really hate code or configuration that I don't understand. It might do magical things, but when things ago awry, and they do, I need to be able to fix it. In this setup, I have handwritten (or at least hand copied :smiley:) every line, and I have tried to document (commit msg or inline comment) why the line exists if it is scary or weird in some way. I encourage you to read the various setup files to understand how it works and prod around yourself :)


## Supports per machine/os settings

_Which_ programs to install and _how_ is of course unique to every operating system. This setup supports this quite fine, so I can get my tools, no matter if macOS or WSL2. 

See [`per-host-config/README.md`](./per-host-config/README.md)

### OS independant utils (macOS and Linux friendly)
Some of the common utilities uses environment switches to handle BSD vs GNU issues and such automatically. Examples of this are `util.esed`  and `util.size`. This way I can use these utils to get (mostly) platform independant scripts :)

## Installation

### WARNING
This repo and its configs includes _my settings_, which means that if you run the `./setup.sh` script, it will _overwrite_ your existing configuration files. 
I have taken steps to ensure that any _personal_ settings involving names are not re-used (was causing issues), so your Git committer info will be safe :)

### Steps
```
git clone https://github.com/fatso83/dotfiles
./dotfiles/setup.sh # and wait until completion ...
```
![install vid](./dotfiles-install.gif "Install video")

The first time you run the install it will take some time, mostly due [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe), which needs to be downloaded and compiled. It might seem as if the install hangs on this step, but this only takes a lot of time the first time you run setup. On subsequent `./setup.sh` runs, it should not take more than a second or two.

## Debugging

### bash.rc related shell issues
For debugging an issue after installing, the first thing is to uncomment the line in `~/.bashrc` that says "# DEBUG=1". This will print out lots of debugging info. The second thing to do, once you now approximately where things go wrong is to add `set -x` (print lots of debugging info on commands executing) and `set -e` (exit on first error - should mostly already be set)l

### sourced files
If you encounter an issue in a sourced file, it might be a bit difficult to debug if they contain `exit 1` or calls to the `error` util. Just do this instead:
```
bash -c "ROOT=$PWD source ./shared.lib"
```
