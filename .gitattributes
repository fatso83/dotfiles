# line endings are normalized to LF on _checkin_.
# this just applies to what git thinks are text files
*   text=auto

# except ... for the special .gitignore_global due to the weird Icon^M file
common-setup/gitignore_global -text

# don't fuck with binaries
*.jpg   -text
*.exe   -text

*.bat       eol=crlf
*.ps1       eol=crlf

# everything - including stuff Git don't think is text - is normalized
common-setup/**  eol=lf

# To view the effect:
# $ rm .git/index     # Remove the index to force Git to
# $ git reset         # re-scan the working directory
# $ git status        # Show files that will be normalized
